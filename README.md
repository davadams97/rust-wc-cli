# rust-wc-cli

## Description
Quick Rust based CLI command that is meant to mimic the output from the "wc" command.

## Motivation 
This small project is meant for me to get my hands on Rust and experiment with the language.

## How to run the project?
- Download [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) 
- In your command line, run `cargo run -- src/test.txt`

Note: This uses the file stored in the `src/` directory. You can test with your own file as well.

Note: This program has limited functionality, it only accepts the following arguments `-c`, `-l`, `-m` and `-w`.
